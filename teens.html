    <h1>Drug use is associated with a variety of negative consequences, including increased risk of serious drug use later in life, school failure, and poor judgment which may put teens at risk for accidents, violence, unplanned and unsafe sex, and suicide.</h1>
    <h2>Preventing drug misuse in children and teenagers
        Take these steps to help prevent drug misuse in your children and teenagers:
        
        Communicate. Talk to your children about the risks of drug use and misuse.
        Listen. Be a good listener when your children talk about peer pressure, and be supportive of their efforts to resist it.
        Set a good example. Don't misuse alcohol or addictive drugs. Children of parents who misuse drugs are at greater risk of drug addiction.
        Strengthen the bond. Work on your relationship with your children. A strong, stable bond between you and your child will reduce your child's risk of using or misusing drugs.</h2>
